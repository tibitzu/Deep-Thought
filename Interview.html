        <b>Elijah Goodlet</b><br>
        Hello, I'm Elijah and I'm
        interviewing Andrew Goodlet.
        He is an IT professional Andrew.
        If you could tell us a bit about
        your IT work, what exactly do you do?
        
        <br><br><b>Andrew Goodlet</b><br>
        Yeah, thanks.
        I'm the group IT manager
        for Galaxy Resources limited.
        We are a, uh, a mining company
        in Western Australia and where,
        UM in the mid tier space and we
        mined lithium as part of my job.
        I look after information technology,
        operational technology and the
        information security as well so.
        Technology involved in the
        day to day activities.
        Your finance your back of house services
        operational technology which is
        here plant and your control systems.
        ATV mining operations and the
        information security elements.
        So working with security companies
        just to ensure that all aspects
        of both it and OT secured.
        
        <br><br><b>Elijah Goodlet</b><br>
        so you're in the mining industry
        and you're working in the back end
        of it into in terms of like the
        industry you work in. 
        
        <br><br><b>Andrew Goodlet</b><br>
        UM, yeah.
        So the type of mining we do from
        exploration right up to ship.
        So that includes mining,
        processing, transport,
        shipping and sending it off
        to our end customer.
        In China,
        
        <br><br><b>Elijah Goodlet</b><br>
        so is there any other
        kinds of work you have to do,
        or does that summarize it?
        
        <br><br><b>Andrew Goodlet</b><br>
        that we also do inside the IT department?
        We do development.
        We have our own development team,
        infrastructure,
        desktop and service desk in
        operational technology we've
        we have process engineers,
        instrument engineers,
        A mixture of UM and also external
        support as well so we can call upon,
        we have partners for each of our
        operations in Australia and globally.
        Who can help with our individual sites?
        
        <br><br><b>Elijah Goodlet</b><br>
        And so are some of the different people
        people you interact with at your work?
        Can you tell us about them?
        
        <br><br><b>Andrew Goodlet</b><br>
        Yeah, look being a senior I team leader.
        we pretty much one of the few
        departments that touch all of the
        other departments in the business so.
        Most activities there is
        a legal component of it,
        so dealing with the company secretary and
        dealing with the legal team in South America,
        North America and Australia.
        We touched upon finance for procurement
        asset management appreciation.
        Problem solving.
        Uh, I work pretty closely with finance.
        Uhm,
        we also work closely with operations.
        That's where IT and technologies
        value add occurs so.
        Yeah, you know,
        we all understand the business,
        how they, how the work is done.
        And, uhm, you know how we actually
        pull something out of the ground
        and then put it onto a ship?
        It's not a super complicated process,
        but there's a lot of effort
        required and the business is.
        It's in this day and age technology
        there is technology out there
        to help different aspects in
        different parts of the business so.
        Where there to help facilitate that
        and to ensure that technology is
        implemented in their consistent,
        secure and does
        right for the company.
        
        <br><br><b>Elijah Goodlet</b><br>
        Fair enough,
        and so are you working with
        many other IT professionals?
        
        <br><br><b>Andrew Goodlet</b><br>
        Yeah,
        so I have a few teamsm I have an operational
        technology team here in Australia.
        IT team here in Australia we have a
        few offices and in Argentina as well.
        There's a mixture of it
        professionals across all of that.
        Vendors communication
        suppliers, hardware suppliers.
        Service providers in in all of the countries.
        So Yep, significant interactions.
        In fact,
        that's the majority of my job is interacting.
        
        <br><br><b>Elijah Goodlet</b><br>
        Do you interact with clients and
        investors or is that out of your
        reach
    
        <br><br><b>Andrew Goodlet</b><br>
        It's a very good question.
        What our who is our clients?
        
        <br><br><b>Elijah Goodlet</b><br>
        Yeah, that is a bit of a question.
    
        <br><br><b>Andrew Goodlet</b><br>
        Who is our client?
        Is it, UM,
        the people that used the technology?
        Or is it the.
        Product that way support being
        mined and then that product
        being given to the customers.
        Is that also it's customer so.
        Yeah, we look in both cases,
        not so much the shipping customer,
        but we ensure that they can communicate
        with us over whatever medium is preferred,
        whether that's a email,
        UC applications, team zoom.
        I would say that IT is needed in that in
        that process it's a fairly standard process.
        But in terms of dealing with the customers,
        absolutely look,
        Technology is,
        it's quite key to ensuring that you're happy.
        Have a happy workforce.
        So yeah,
        investors,
        not so much look the we do help the
        investor or public relations team
        with a GM's if there's technology
        required with they deal with the
        service desk to get that done.
        Something that will have events
        at universities or the CSIRO
        and technology is provided.
        Assistance is provided from the
        teams for the those events.
    
        <br><br><b>Elijah Goodlet</b><br>
        That's pretty neat.
        So what aspects of your work do
        you spend most of your time on?
    
        <br><br><b>Andrew Goodlet</b><br>
        Yeah,
        personally myself as the group
        IT manager for Galaxy,
        I spend a lot of my time reviewing plans.
        Deciding on how IT or OT will respond to
        a business request after the information
        is provided to me by relevant teams.
        Financing insuring that you know
        we're not hemorrhaging money
        across the different services,
        Yeah, customer customer satisfaction
        is is a very strong point for me so.
        Just ensuring that all the work that
        that is output from the department.
        It's done at a higher level.
    
        <br><br><b>Elijah Goodlet</b><br>
        so which of those would be
        the most difficult parts you found?
        The most difficult do you think?
    
        <br><br><b>Andrew Goodlet</b><br>
        Uh, look, I think achieving buy in or
        selling what is a great idea to people
        who may not know is that's.
        It's continue effort you have to.
        You have to sell the story and you like and
        you have to sell this story at every chain.
        
        <br><br><b>Elijah Goodlet</b><br>
        OK so taking your ideas and pushing them
        forward up the chain of command can be
        a bit Difficult?
    
        <br><br><b>Andrew Goodlet</b><br>
        yeah absolutely.
        You know, for example,
        we'll update in a a fuel farm,
        which is a essentially your own
        petrol station on a mine site.
        It was analog. It broke down often and.
        You know people had to write down how
        many liters they've taken out.
        The browsers put into either a
        a light vehicle or a full drive,
        or a heavy vehicle.
        A giant mine truck and there would
        be issues with reconciling these
        numbers at the end of the month.
        Lost fuel fuel beeing last technically,
        but you know the staff,
        accounting errors and.
        Yeah,
        we could sympathize with the with
        the staff on site or the store's
        team that had to manage this
        fuel station or the fuel farm.
        But it wasn't until IT kind
        of got involved and said hey,
        this isn't just stores complaining.
        This is affecting the whole business and
        we had to kind of because of the spend.
        To rectify this.
        You know you're talking 10s of thousands
        of dollars here and I just said look,
        this is an 
        Echelon amount of better let's,
        let's get you would it would
        be silly not to do this so.
        Yeah look selling it,
        but it's also it's it can also
        be pretty rewarding as well.
        So yeah,
    
        <br><br><b>Elijah Goodlet</b><br>
        so can you give an example of the
        work you do that best captures
        the essence of the IT industry?
        If you've got a story like that?
        
        <br><br><b>Andrew Goodlet</b><br>
        Uhm, look in my personal opinion, uhm.
        The. An IT department or an effective
        one is not there just to provide.
        Access to Microsoft Office or the Internet.
        It's there to provide a tool
        to the people that use that.
        It has to be safe.
        It has to be secure.
        It has to work all of the time.
        So with that you have it management you have
        your you have your system administrators,
        you have your desktop administrators.
        You leverage cloud services.
        So deliver that cheaply,
        consistently.
        If I was to do an example,
        UM, you know, I'm a big.
        I'm a big fan of ensuring that
        people have great communications.
        Infrastructure in that regard is essential
        for pretty much any other service.
        Your voice he camps your
        real time communications.
        If you don't have good infrastructure.
        The. Experience that our business users
        have a is not going to be great either, so.
        Uhm? Yeah look, I I like providing
        good experiences for people,
        ensuring that they can surf the net
        if that's what they want to do or
        access their power if they want to do.
        Or hey, this is the software package or hey,
        come to us. What can you do like?
        What happen?
        You know IT people generally like to help.
        They may be introverts.
        They might be shy,
        but at their core they just want people to.
        They want to share technology,
        embrace it and then pass the idea on.
    
        <br><br><b>Elijah Goodlet</b><br>
        I think that's a great place to end it.
        That's all the questions I have for you,
        Andrew.
        Thank you so much for taking
        the time out of your day.
        This was a really cool conversation.
        Thank you.
