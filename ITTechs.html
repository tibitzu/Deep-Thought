    <h1>Automated Cars</h1>
           <p>The new technology<br><br>
  The new state-of-the-art technology is autonomous automobiles removing the need for human input the move around cities and towns.
  What can be done now due to this new technology is to reduce the yearly road toll by removing human error out of all major incidents, therefore saving lives and allowing more autonomous shipping throughout countries.
  In the next few years, interstate truck travel could be a thing of the past for a truck driver with car companies like Volvo, Mercedes Benz, and tesla continuously pushing the envelope of self-driving vehicles.
  With the combination of big tech giants and state-of-the-art technology with the ability to have three-dimensional object detection built-in tracking systems, this being in conjunction with normal radar detection systems and Lidar systems built into the automobile.
  Lidar scanners bounce a laser light of an object to gauge distance and depth which is then sent back into the computer as an object or as a block in front of the car, by using lidar scanners rather than photogrammetry or infrared scanners the driverless car has a clearer picture of what is around it, therefore, allowing the car and the computer to use its accompanying sensors to allow the car to navigate intersections busy cityscapes and windy mountainous backroads.
  The technology that is already used in mass in modern automobiles like blind-spot monitoring, rear parking sensors, 360-degree cameras these aids are there to help the driver line the car up when parking.
  These technologies that are used at low speed can also be used at high speed to keep the car in the lane when driving at speed on the freeway the technology and programming in lane assist can be used in the future to create and programming autonomous automobiles.
  With the advent of these sensors and the possibility of automotive manufactures adapting lidar sensors among other technologies to bring forward the plan of driverless vehicles in the next few years.
  Companies like BMW have started to heavily invest in lidar technology for their flagship models due to their built-in lane assist and their Mobileye around autonomous driving, Lyft partnership with BMW to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service with the use of Lyft’s technology within their car.
  To add to the forever-changing far scape of the automotive industry Mercedes Benz has begun experimenting with not just self-driving technology but the ability to drive the car with your mind. Their inspiration to build this said car was the same technology that we saw a few years ago in the movie avatar,
  The AVTR from Mercedes Benz uses electrodes built into a helmet that the occupant can wear to control the car or can think of a direction and a location for the car to travel to and take you there.
  But as Mercedes has purely left this in the concept stage currently and only has the internal interface and computer systems operational as is purely experimental, we are unaware in the future where this technology can take us, but I expect companies like Mercedes Benz to lead the way over the big tech giants that we would have expected to lead such endeavors into the driverless car due to their resources that they have at any given time, as they are more technology companies now then just automobile manufacturers,
  <br><br>
  Future impacts
  <br><br>
  The potential impact of driverless cars could change the way we travel and see the world, by being able to jump into any car at any time and you will no longer have to pay for fuel, you may never own a car again, you may never need to pay for fuel again.
  This means in theory you can be on the side of the road in the future needing to go somewhere you signal a car on the side of the road with your hand or even a mobile phone.
  Then you jump in the car that stops beside you on the road and takes you to the destination of your choice because this could change the way we look at transportation as a human race especially in areas of worldwide logistics due to the fact the technology can be adapted to other modes of transportation with enough research.
  However, it will affect people’s livelihoods in these areas due to the reduction of manpower required in this bustling industry that is always working 24/7 to meet online demands and fulfill international shipping orders, this means that shipping in the future could be automated including even container transportation 
  These people can be affected by the loss of jobs in the logistic and private sector due to the removal of the need to pay someone for driving you from point to point, this putting all these people out of work, this job redundancy can have a massive effect on jobs in the transportation industry due to the removal of drivers.  
  This means there will be the removal of laboring and the removal of drivers in many industries this is regarding taxi drivers and truck drivers this could create an issue to income to many families that rely on these transportation industries are their financial income, by creating this work shortage the people who were once professionals in this industry will have to either reskill find new work or even get on universal basic income provided this is a thing in a future timeline.
  How will this affect me?
  In my daily life this would affect the way I travel to work due to the fact I travel more than thirty kilometers to work, it would also be different transporting things in the car due to having more room in the cabin due to the fact my car is generally fairly full with various items, however, the removal of controls would save space in the interior and open up space for more relaxing capabilities and or storage space, but in my personal opinion this is still not worth losing control of your automobile.
  What will be different for me personally would be very sad because I enjoy driving my car around from point A to point B I enjoy going thru the winding mountain roads and not being able to do that would be disconcerting, from an emotional standpoint because I find it enjoyable. 
  I would not be the only one that would start feeling depressed if there Is no way to drive the car that I own, another thing unrelated but highly important to vehicles is how insurance laws work around autonomous vehicles, being in the motoring industry they need to have insurance to protect the occupant and the vehicle autonomous cars circumvent that.
  This could affect family life in many ways due to the fact I have family that lives close, as well as far away it would be nice not to drive three hundred kilometers away. 
  But driving also that distance and being able to drive that distance and also completing the road trip can also be an accomplishment and driving the distance enjoying music because driving that long distance to see your family, that is worth driving and its not worth letting a computer drive that distance for you.

    <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>
      Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can automatically improve through experience.
      The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, Tom M. Mitchell later provided a more
      formal definition:
      <br>
      <i>"A computer program is said to learn from experience (E) with respect to some class of tasks (T) and
       performance measure (P) if its performance at tasks in (T), as measured by (P), improves with experience (E)."</i>
      - Mitchell, T. (1997). Machine Learning. McGraw Hill
      <br>
      Algorithms are given a large amount of sample data to 'train' to find patterns and correlations. After doing so the program can make predictions for desired outputs. They do this by creating neural networks.<br>
      To simplify it a set of already completed data and takes an input layer where it gathers all information it has, then processes it in a "hidden" layer which applies different equations to make the final output layer. The program does these hundreds of times and compares each output to the desired output gaining accuracy over time. it shares similarities without own human brains and as such gained the title "neural networks"
      <br>
      It's already used in programs everywhere. for example, email filtering can see what users usually report as spam and find trends to automatically flag new emails as spam. recording what the user declares as spam and then extrapolating the data to apply to later incoming emails
      This is great because creating a conventional algorithm would be very difficult. Another feature is the programs ability to keep up to date. a conventional algorithm would have to be manually updated, but often machine learning programs like the email filter can just receive more sample data to increase capabilities.
      <br>
      It's being taken further in image recognition services. Social media platforms like Facebook use it to automatically tag users. allowing easy notifying of those included in photos.
      <br>
      One of the most futuristic current uses is in self-driving cars. using image recognition to identify hazards, cars roadsigns and more. please see the relevant page on our website. being a core part of Artificial intelligence,  machine learning is necessary for these inventions to be used.
      <br>
      Unfourtantley the biggest current hindrance to its widespread usage is obtaining experience, its sample data. Sample data can be 'bad data' in multiple ways, such as not enough data, non-representative data, poor quality data, irrelevant features. This was seen in multiple facial recognition software where, due to sampling a primarily white collection of people, the facial detection had a much harder time differentiating from darker-skinned individuals.  it is likely however to get better over time and as algorithms get made smarter and fewer data would be necessary.
      <br>
      In the future, we will continue to see Machine learning in the medical field where it is currently being used to assist doctors in diagnosis. In one example a machine learning algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97% making this a powerful tool for doctors. Due to the nature of machine learning the better it gets the more people simply disregard its use as "just an alogorythim" as machine learning at its best is very simple and quick to use. No one is amazed at YouTube's recommendation feature even though the technology behind it is adapting millions of key points of data. This could lead to a future where machine learning may be just an automatic assumption, Always used but never considered.

  <h1>Robotics</h1>
  <p>There are fascinating developments going on in the world of robots. Robots have helped us to automate many repetitive tasks and made mass production possible. To this day robots have been used to automate processes that are repetitive, tedious and dangerous for humans. For precise movement quite a rigid frame is needed to allow the movements to be in a range of tolerances.

Rigid frames to become a problem when a robot is in a sensitive environment. Fast moving powerful robots can do lot of damage when something not planned to their usual work environment is being introduced. That’s why a specific sub field of robotics has emerged.

Soft robots are made of materials that are flexible and compliant such as soft plastic and silicone elastomers. They are mostly powered by pressured air or fluids, but researchers are working on a methods that allow them to control and move through electric fields or thermal manipulation.

Often bio-inspired like mimicking octopus arms a twisting grasping arm was designed to retrieve objects obstructing in tight spaces like inside of pipes (https://www.advancedsciencenews.com/mimicking-the-motions-of-the-multitalented-octopus) or Mariana snailfish inspired deep sea exploration device that can withstand extreme pressures(https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-soft-robot-snailfish-crushing-pressures-deep-ocean).

Right now soft robots are still in baby steps.

Medical use

They have great potential in the field of medical devices for minimal invasive surgery. Robot bodies that are mode of soft materials will reduce the risk of causing damage to tissues and organs during endoscopic ( in body) procedures. So far treating brain cancer on patients has had quite low survival rate because of the tumor tissue being very difficult to remove  using conventional methods due to limited access. Soft robot technology has a change to change that.

( Minimally Invasive Neurosurgical Intracranial Robot (MINI and MINIR-II) is a project with great potential to make brain tumor tissue removal much safer for the patient. It is a flexible snake like design consisting of three segments that are actuated using four SMA (shape memory alloy) spring actuators. When current is applied the spring generates displacement, when cooled it returns back to default value)

Other Possible use cases: Wearable soft Robots, Prosthetics, Origami robots, Deep sea exploration </p>
