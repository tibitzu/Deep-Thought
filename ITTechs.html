    <h1>Automated Cars</h1>
      <h2>The New Technology
        <br><br>
      </h2>
      <p>The new state-of-the-art technology is autonomous automobiles removing the need for human input the move around cities and towns.
  What can be done now due to this new technology is to reduce the yearly road toll by removing human error out of all major incidents, therefore saving lives and allowing more autonomous shipping throughout countries.
  In the next few years, interstate truck travel could be a thing of the past for a truck driver with car companies like Volvo, Mercedes Benz, and tesla continuously pushing the envelope of self-driving vehicles.
  With the combination of big tech giants and state-of-the-art technology with the ability to have three-dimensional object detection built-in tracking systems, this being in conjunction with normal radar detection systems and Lidar systems built into the automobile.
  Lidar scanners bounce a laser light of an object to gauge distance and depth which is then sent back into the computer as an object or as a block in front of the car, by using lidar scanners rather than photogrammetry or infrared scanners the driverless car has a clearer picture of what is around it, therefore, allowing the car and the computer to use its accompanying sensors to allow the car to navigate intersections busy cityscapes and windy mountainous backroads.
  The technology that is already used in mass in modern automobiles like blind-spot monitoring, rear parking sensors, 360-degree cameras these aids are there to help the driver line the car up when parking.
  These technologies that are used at low speed can also be used at high speed to keep the car in the lane when driving at speed on the freeway the technology and programming in lane assist can be used in the future to create and programming autonomous automobiles.
  With the advent of these sensors and the possibility of automotive manufactures adapting lidar sensors among other technologies to bring forward the plan of driverless vehicles in the next few years.
  Companies like BMW have started to heavily invest in lidar technology for their flagship models due to their built-in lane assist and their Mobileye around autonomous driving, Lyft partnership with BMW to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service with the use of Lyft’s technology within their car.
  To add to the forever-changing far scape of the automotive industry Mercedes Benz has begun experimenting with not just self-driving technology but the ability to drive the car with your mind. Their inspiration to build this said car was the same technology that we saw a few years ago in the movie avatar,
  The AVTR from Mercedes Benz uses electrodes built into a helmet that the occupant can wear to control the car or can think of a direction and a location for the car to travel to and take you there.
  But as Mercedes has purely left this in the concept stage currently and only has the internal interface and computer systems operational as is purely experimental, we are unaware in the future where this technology can take us, but I expect companies like Mercedes Benz to lead the way over the big tech giants that we would have expected to lead such endeavors into the driverless car due to their resources that they have at any given time, as they are more technology companies now then just automobile manufacturers,
        <br><br>
      </p>
      <h2>Future Impacts
        <br><br>
      </h2>
      <p>The potential impact of driverless cars could change the way we travel and see the world, by being able to jump into any car at any time and you will no longer have to pay for fuel, you may never own a car again, you may never need to pay for fuel again.
  This means in theory you can be on the side of the road in the future needing to go somewhere you signal a car on the side of the road with your hand or even a mobile phone.
  Then you jump in the car that stops beside you on the road and takes you to the destination of your choice because this could change the way we look at transportation as a human race especially in areas of worldwide logistics due to the fact the technology can be adapted to other modes of transportation with enough research.
  However, it will affect people’s livelihoods in these areas due to the reduction of manpower required in this bustling industry that is always working 24/7 to meet online demands and fulfill international shipping orders, this means that shipping in the future could be automated including even container transportation 
  These people can be affected by the loss of jobs in the logistic and private sector due to the removal of the need to pay someone for driving you from point to point, this putting all these people out of work, this job redundancy can have a massive effect on jobs in the transportation industry due to the removal of drivers.  
  This means there will be the removal of laboring and the removal of drivers in many industries this is regarding taxi drivers and truck drivers this could create an issue to income to many families that rely on these transportation industries are their financial income, by creating this work shortage the people who were once professionals in this industry will have to either reskill find new work or even get on universal basic income provided this is a thing in a future timeline.
  How will this affect me?
  In my daily life this would affect the way I travel to work due to the fact I travel more than thirty kilometers to work, it would also be different transporting things in the car due to having more room in the cabin due to the fact my car is generally fairly full with various items, however, the removal of controls would save space in the interior and open up space for more relaxing capabilities and or storage space, but in my personal opinion this is still not worth losing control of your automobile.
  What will be different for me personally would be very sad because I enjoy driving my car around from point A to point B I enjoy going thru the winding mountain roads and not being able to do that would be disconcerting, from an emotional standpoint because I find it enjoyable. 
  I would not be the only one that would start feeling depressed if there Is no way to drive the car that I own, another thing unrelated but highly important to vehicles is how insurance laws work around autonomous vehicles, being in the motoring industry they need to have insurance to protect the occupant and the vehicle autonomous cars circumvent that.
  This could affect family life in many ways due to the fact I have family that lives close, as well as far away it would be nice not to drive three hundred kilometers away. 
  But driving also that distance and being able to drive that distance and also completing the road trip can also be an accomplishment and driving the distance enjoying music because driving that long distance to see your family, that is worth driving and its not worth letting a computer drive that distance for you.

    <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>
      Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can automatically improve through experience.
      The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, Tom M. Mitchell later provided a more
      formal definition:
      <br>
      <i>"A computer program is said to learn from experience (E) with respect to some class of tasks (T) and
       performance measure (P) if its performance at tasks in (T), as measured by (P), improves with experience (E)."</i>
      - Mitchell, T. (1997). Machine Learning. McGraw Hill
      <br>
      Algorithms are given a large amount of sample data to 'train' to find patterns and correlations. After doing so the program can make predictions for desired outputs. They do this by creating neural networks.<br>
      To simplify it a set of already completed data and takes an input layer where it gathers all information it has, then processes it in a "hidden" layer which applies different equations to make the final output layer. The program does these hundreds of times and compares each output to the desired output gaining accuracy over time. it shares similarities without own human brains and as such gained the title "neural networks"
      <br>
      It's already used in programs everywhere. for example, email filtering can see what users usually report as spam and find trends to automatically flag new emails as spam. recording what the user declares as spam and then extrapolating the data to apply to later incoming emails
      This is great because creating a conventional algorithm would be very difficult. Another feature is the programs ability to keep up to date. a conventional algorithm would have to be manually updated, but often machine learning programs like the email filter can just receive more sample data to increase capabilities.
      <br>
      It's being taken further in image recognition services. Social media platforms like Facebook use it to automatically tag users. allowing easy notifying of those included in photos.
      <br>
      One of the most futuristic current uses is in self-driving cars. using image recognition to identify hazards, cars roadsigns and more. please see the relevant page on our website. being a core part of Artificial intelligence,  machine learning is necessary for these inventions to be used.
      <br>
      Unfourtantley the biggest current hindrance to its widespread usage is obtaining experience, its sample data. Sample data can be 'bad data' in multiple ways, such as not enough data, non-representative data, poor quality data, irrelevant features. This was seen in multiple facial recognition software where, due to sampling a primarily white collection of people, the facial detection had a much harder time differentiating from darker-skinned individuals.  it is likely however to get better over time and as algorithms get made smarter and fewer data would be necessary.
      <br>
      In the future, we will continue to see Machine learning in the medical field where it is currently being used to assist doctors in diagnosis. In one example a machine learning algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97% making this a powerful tool for doctors. Due to the nature of machine learning the better it gets the more people simply disregard its use as "just an alogorythim" as machine learning at its best is very simple and quick to use. No one is amazed at YouTube's recommendation feature even though the technology behind it is adapting millions of key points of data. This could lead to a future where machine learning may be just an automatic assumption, Always used but never considered.

  <h1>The Cloud: Cloud Computing & Technology
    <br><br>
  </h1>

   <h2>What is it, what does it do?
    <br>
   </h2>
    <p>Cloud Computing has played an integral part in the way we use technology
      and the internet in the modern age. ‘The Cloud’ referring to cloud
      computing, has become the foundation of how technology, systems,
      applications and data storage is interacted with, from an individual to
      conglomerate scale (Ranger 2018; Shmatko et al. 2020). Originally the
      benefit of the cloud was its flexibility and convenience to remotely store
      data, however, as technology has advanced so too did the capabilities,
      insofar as supplying access to substantial remote processing power all as
      long as there is reliable access to the internet (Techquickie 2014;
      Shmatko et al. 2020; Cloudflare 2021). This enhanced processing power is
      only possible due to Cloud Service Providers (CSP) the likes of Amazon Web
      Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform and Alibaba Cloud (the
      top 4 cloud providers) building the IT infrastructure required for the
      cloud to function. This done through a network of servers (a series of
      connected computers) allows individuals and companies to gain access to
      infrastructure and resources which normally would require high upfront
      costs for hardware/software, physical space, data; storage, maintenance,
      security and recovery, these being some of the limiting factors for
      flexible scalability (Techquickie 2014; Ecourse Review 2017; Simplilearn
      2020; Cloudflare 2021). The benefits of the cloud is that it subsides
      these upfront costs with a ‘Pay as you go’ model, so when required an
      individual or company can purchase the certain amount of resources needed
      for the job or time period whilst having the ability to increase or
      decrease the amount of resources required, be-it extra storage or
      processing it is all available on demand and enables great flexibility
      and scalability for the consumer (Techquickie 2014; Ecourse Review 2017;
      Simplilearn 2020). Furthermore, the convenience provided by CPS’s
      through the ‘pay as you go’ model reduces the costs for hardware and
      software, enables effective data recovery in case a data center is
      compromised the consumer data is backed up at multiple locations, improved
      data security, reliable technical support and finally greater mobility and
      accessibility (Techquickie 2014; Ranger 2018; Shmatko et al. 2020;
      Simplilearn 2020; Cloudflare 2021). To expand, the mobility and
      accessibility provided by the cloud is one of its core benefits, the
      ability to use applications, services, retrieve and store data all whilst
      being on the move is very valuable more-so in our current climate then
      before, being able to work from home or remotely allows the consumer to
      have more freedoms in who they work with, how work is can be conducted
      and where they can work, removing the limitations of the past. Furthermore
      , the accessibility of the cloud means that access to applications,
      services or data can all be done through smaller or lower powered devices
      all in the spirit of being cost effective to the consumer (Techquickie
      2014; Shmatko et al. 2020; Simplilearn 2020; Cloudflare 2021).
     <br><br>
      Currently companies such as Amazon through Amazon Web Services offer over
      200 services through the cloud these encompassing the 3 most common
      delivery models of cloud computing; Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform
      as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), each giving
      the developer different scales of control in how they utilise the cloud
      (Ecourse Review 2017; Ranger 2018 Fireship 2019; Amazon Web Services 2021;
      Cloudflare 2021). SaaS refers to the common public cloud (able to be
      accessed by anyone) services such as data storage through Google Drive,
      Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox, this also includes video streaming services
      the likes of Netflix or Youtube and in regards to processing power
      examples include Google Workspace (Google Docs, Sheets, Slide, etc.) or
      Microsoft 365. PaaS coincides more with software or application
      development, as it offers greater control to the developer granting them
      access to more specialised tools for creating testing and maintaining
      software. Finally IaaS is used mostly in System/IT Administration as these
      can provide access to computing infrastructure enabling the use of
      virtual machines or private storage storage only accessible specifically
      by that company alongside even more specialised tools (Ecourse Review
      2017; Fireship 2019; Simplilearn 2020; Cloudflare 2021). These three
      cloud deployment models are not the only models but are the most widely
      used, with the increased adaptation and accelerated advancement of this
      technology more and more models are being created (such as Function as a
      Service (FaaS)), with more widespread use of cloud computing having been
      made possible, as other fields of IT and technology that of Machine
      Learning, Artificial Intelligence and even Cloud Gaming benefit and make
      strides as they continue implementing and employing the power of the
      cloud and the attached economic benefits. (Techquickie 2014; fireship
      2019; Shmatko et al. 2020).
     <br><br>
    </p>

   <h2>Future Impact
    <br>
   </h2>
     <p>The impact of Cloud Technology has risen exponentially over the decade
       with companies and individuals alike utilising the cloud in their
       everyday services and internet usage. As this technology has continued to
       develop the financial costs associated continue to decrease whilst the
       benefits have increased, with the switch to cloud services removing the
       costs associated with having on-premises of the physical space, hardware
       and accompanying software, the staff required to install, maintain,
       update and recovery the it infrastructure, and lastly data storage and
       security all being key factors which are involved in maintaining a
       digital workplace (Shmatko et al. 2020; Ali et al. 2021; Cloud Flare
       2021). The switch to the cloud and reliance of Cloud Service Provider
       eliminates the costs associated with having a robust it infrastructure as
       the consumer only pays for the resources they require be-it data storage,
       processing power or more complex systems, the consumer no longer needs to
       maintain their own infrastructure (Techquickie 2014; Ecourse Review 2017;
       Simplilearn 2020; Cloudflare 2021). This all being a benefit to the
       scalability for a consumer as they have on demand access to increase of
       decrease the amount of resources which they use as they require,
       furthermore, this including the outsourcing their required infrastructure
       in to their desired scale (Ecourse Review 2017; Ranger 2018 Fireship
       2019; Amazon Web Services 2021; Cloudflare 2021). Outside of the 3 common
       cloud delivery models; Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a
       Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) a new model has
       gained popularity as it gives more specified outsourcing of cloud
       infrastructure. Called Function as a Service (FaaS) alternatively named
       ‘Serverless Computing’, by breaking down cloud services into smaller
       components this model will only run when needed in addition to scaling in
       relation to the amount of demand of service (Cloudflare 2021). Though
       being named “serverless” FaaS services still operate on servers just not
       their own dedicated machines as the consumer would not have acquired a
       dedicated server but a section of a server (Cloudflare 2021).
      <br><br>
       The effect of FaaS and the 3 cloud deployment models and potential newer
       methods is very positive, more-so in the added reduction of costs as
       consumers are able to choose the appropriate model associated with their
       needs (Shmatko et al. 2020; Ali et al. 2021; Cloud Flare 2021). However,
       with more options comes ‘Choice/Option Paralysis’ defined by Lexico in
       association with the Oxford Dictionary (2021) as “The inability to make a
       decision when presented with a wide range of choices'' as consumers have
       to decide on which service may apply to their specific use case,
       compounded with a lack of understanding of the differing cloud delivery
       models due to the recency of cloud technology, specifically the drastic
       advancement of the technology (Shmatko et al. 2020; Ali et al. 2021;
       Cloudflare 2021). Amidst this a new IT profession has become more
       valuable than ever, these being ‘Cloud Architects’ (Shesshy 2019;
       Shmatko et al. 2020; Ali et al. 2021). Cloud Architects are given the
       task of facilitating the consumer's switch to the cloud, providing the
       oversight for the architecture, design and implementation of the
       appropriate cloud model to the desired service in addition to monitoring
       and analysis of the effectiveness of the service (Shesshy 2019; Shmatko
       et al. 2020; Ali et al. 2021). Alongside other members of a ‘Technology
       team’ ensure that cloud computing is able to be implemented successfully
       and used effectively all whilst being financially viable for the consumer
       (Shesshy 2019).
      <br><br>
     </p>

   <h2>Current Impact
    <br>
   </h2>
     <p>In the daily life of our group cloud technology is used very frequently,
       both in university work and personally. through the Software as a Service
       (SaaS) cloud delivery model offered by Google, Microsoft (MS) through
       applications like ‘Google Drive: Cloud Storage’, ‘Google Workshop’, ‘MS
       365’, ‘MS Teams’. These services provide either cloud storage or utilise
       cloud processing to provide for our personal needs but also the needs of
       our family friends and millions of other users globally, this technology
       is and will continue to integrate and intertwine itself further into our
       daily lives with the benefits of this technology far outweighing the
       costs with the rapid improvement of this technology.

  <h1>Robotics</h1>
  <h2>Soft robots
<br><br>
</h2>
<p>There are fascinating developments going on in the world of robots. Robots have helped us to automate many repetitive tasks and made mass production possible. To this day robots have been used to automate processes that are repetitive, tedious, and dangerous for humans. For precise movement quite a rigid frame is needed to allow the movements to be in a range of tolerances.
Rigid frames to become a problem when a robot is in a sensitive environment. Fast moving powerful robots can do lot of damage when something not planned to their usual work environment is being introduced. That is why a specific sub field of robotics has emerged.
Soft robots are made of materials that are flexible and compliant such as soft plastic and silicone elastomers. They are mostly powered by pressured air or fluids, but researchers are working on a method that allow them to control and move through electric fields or thermal manipulation.
Often bio-inspired like mimicking octopus arms a twisting grasping arm was designed to retrieve objects obstructing in tight spaces like inside of pipes () Or Mariana snailfish inspired deep sea exploration device that can withstand extreme pressures.Right now, soft robots are still in baby steps.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Medical use
<br><br>
</h2>
<p>They have enormous potential in the field of medical devices for minimal invasive surgery. Robot bodies that are mode of soft materials will reduce the risk of causing damage to tissues and organs during endoscopic (in body) procedures. So far treating brain cancer on patients has had quite low survival rate because of the tumour tissue being exceedingly difficult to remove using conventional methods due to limited access. Soft robot technology has a change to change that.
() Minimally Invasive Neurosurgical Intracranial Robot (MINI and MINIR-II) is a project with enormous potential to make brain tumour tissue removal much safer for the patient. It is a flexible snake like design consisting of three segments that are actuated using four SMA (shape memory alloy) spring actuators. When current is applied the spring generates displacement, when cooled it returns to default value)
The world we live in tends to be a very rigid world but due to advancements in technology robots with deformable bodies are starting to be experimented in areas of robotics they are starting to use smart fabrics to begin a new generation of soft robotics.
This means the possibility for black panther suits in real life with the suit being able to react to its external environment it could be used in the future to increase human strength or endurance,
However, the suits are still having expansion issues due to the use of conductive fabrics this also creates a size reduction due the electricity flowing thru them, as much as I think we would like these suits to be a part of our lives now it is simply impossible due the many Kilowatts of energy required for even a small amount of tension,
However, the idea of a deictic elastomer is a very cool emerging technology that must be watched in the future.
Another great achievement made in advanced robotics are using soft robots in deep sea exploration the bonus to running a technology like this in this field is that they can survive the underwater pressure easier and might in future be able to explore all corners of the ocean, these soft robots are designed on the deepest living fish the marina snailfish these soft robots will require less pressure compensation systems why at the same time being more versatile then conventional technology used to explore the deep sea.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Potential impact
<br><br>
</h2>
<p>Deep sea soft robots would allow people to explore more of the ocean bed in a safe space like we do currently but if the technology comes to market, I think we will be able to do deep sea exploration easier and cheaper than before, this would not result in a job loss due to exploration ships having small crews with advanced technology on board already
The use of soft robots is still exceedingly small comparing to traditional robots. There is lot of potential in the medical field and great benefits during surgeries, because they are always steady handed and rarely ever falter in extremely tense circumstances, unlike the human body and brain.
They have the potential to make non-invasive surgery safer. With the advancements of material science and manufacturing methods new materials are being created that can be used to make soft robots more useful
New jobs will hopefully be created for the loss of surgeons due to the technological advancements however I do not think robots will forever replace the doctor in a surgery because they will always be there to watch the surgery get undertaken.
A doctor would never leave a machine to do their bidding as it is against the Hippocratic oath which is what they take to become a doctor, this effectively means their job is to heal not to maim.
Because of these soft tissue robots are used in an assistance manner due to the nature of the industry and would allow more jobs to come to fruition with the fact these machines still would need Maintenace and upkeep, I think the job loss and gain would balance out because of losing nurses the industry would gain mechanics and technicians to maintain them,
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>How this affects me?
<br><br>
</h2>
<p>Deep's sea soft robotics will not change my life to much because of the chance of us using one would be slim to none due to the fact it falls under a niche and extremely specialised.
Having soft robotics in the medical industry could affect people I know in the industry and eventually make their lives easier, due to the fact they operate fairly frequently and have spent a lot of money on medical supplies and equipment, the technology when it is finally released however would be extremely expensive and is still most definitely many years out,
I do not see them uptalking to the technology straight away either due them using tried and true methods in their industry.
I hope that it will not affect me in anyway due to the fact I personally do not like surgery and or injections I think if it were a life threating surgery, I would still rather have a qualified doctor,
Just because they have the actual experience but the training to fix things if anything goes wrong if a machine is following programming its only as smart as its programmer,
The experience from a doctor on the ground has a lot more trusted knowledge then an innovative technology that can do the job for you.
This could affect family and friends in many ways it could change the way we perceive the medical industry someday; operations could never be the same with the advancement in soft robot technology and for the matter-of-fact robotics in general,
It will redefine everything things could be more precise in the future; we could have procedures done in our own home if they go to the free market entirely, no more doctors' visits.
