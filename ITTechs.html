  <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
  <p>Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can automatically improve through experience.
    The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, Tom M. Mitchell later provided a more
    formal definiton:
    
    <i>"A computer program is said to learn from experience (E) with respect to some class of tasks (T) and
     performance measure (P) if its performance at tasks in (T), as measured by (P), improves with experience (E)."</i>
    - Mitchell, T. (1997). Machine Learning. McGraw Hill
    
    Algorithms are given a large amount of sample data to 'train' to find patterns and correlations.
    After doing so the program can make predictions for desired outputs.
    
    It's already used in programs everywhere. for example, email filtering can see what users usually report as 
    spam and find trends to automatically flag new emails as spam. This is great because creating a 
    conventional algorithm would be very difficult. Another feature is the programs ability to keep up to date.
    a conventional algorithm would have to be manually updated, but often machine learning programs like the
    email filter can just receive more sample data to increase capabilities.
    
    Its being taken further in image recogniton services. Social media platforms like Facebook use it to
    automaticly tag people</p>
