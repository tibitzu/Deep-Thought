Researchers' algorithm designs soft robots that sense
<br>
Deep-learning technique optimizes the arrangement of sensors on a robot's body to ensure efficient operation.

What does it do? (600 words) What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?
<br>
Soft robots
<br>
There are fascinating developments going on in the world of robots. Robots have helped us to automate many repetitive tasks and made mass production possible. To this day robots have been used to automate processes that are repetitive, tedious and dangerous for humans. For precise movement quite a rigid frame is needed to allow the movements to be in a range of tolerances.
<br>
Rigid frames to become a problem when a robot is in a sensitive environment. Fast moving powerful robots can do lot of damage when something not planned to their usual work environment is being introduced. Thatâ€™s why a specific sub field of robotics has emerged.
<br>
Soft robots are made of materials that are flexible and compliant such as soft plastic and silicone elastomers. They are mostly powered by pressured air or fluids, but researchers are working on a methods that allow them to control and move through electric fields or thermal manipulation.
<br>
Often bio-inspired like mimicking octopus arms a twisting grasping arm was designed to retrieve objects obstructing in tight spaces like inside of pipes (https://www.advancedsciencenews.com/mimicking-the-motions-of-the-multitalented-octopus) or Mariana snailfish inspired deep sea exploration device that can withstand extreme pressures(https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-soft-robot-snailfish-crushing-pressures-deep-ocean).
<br>
Right now soft robots are still in baby steps.
<br>
Medical use
<br>
They have great potential in the field of medical devices for minimal invasive surgery. Robot bodies that are mode of soft materials will reduce the risk of causing damage to tissues and organs during endoscopic ( in body) procedures. So far treating brain cancer on patients has had quite low survival rate because of the tumor tissue being very difficult to remove  using conventional methods due to limited access. Soft robot technology has a change to change that.
<br>
(https://robomed.gatech.edu/minir/) Minimally Invasive Neurosurgical Intracranial Robot (MINI and MINIR-II) is a project with great potential to make brain tumor tissue removal much safer for the patient. It is a flexible snake like design consisting of three segments that are actuated using four SMA (shape memory alloy) spring actuators. When current is applied the spring generates displacement, when cooled it returns back to default value)

  <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
  <p>
    Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can automatically improve through experience.
    The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, Tom M. Mitchell later provided a more
    formal definition:
    <br>
    <i>"A computer program is said to learn from experience (E) with respect to some class of tasks (T) and
     performance measure (P) if its performance at tasks in (T), as measured by (P), improves with experience (E)."</i>
    - Mitchell, T. (1997). Machine Learning. McGraw Hill
    <br>
    Algorithms are given a large amount of sample data to 'train' to find patterns and correlations. After doing so the program can make predictions for desired outputs. They do this by creating neural networks.<br>
    To simplify it a set of already completed data and takes an input layer where it gathers all information it has, then processes it in a "hidden" layer which applies different equations to make the final output layer. The program does these hundreds of times and compares each output to the desired output gaining accuracy over time. it shares similarities without own human brains and as such gained the title "neural networks"
    <br>
    It's already used in programs everywhere. for example, email filtering can see what users usually report as spam and find trends to automatically flag new emails as spam. recording what the user declares as spam and then extrapolating the data to apply to later incoming emails 
    This is great because creating a conventional algorithm would be very difficult. Another feature is the programs ability to keep up to date. a conventional algorithm would have to be manually updated, but often machine learning programs like the email filter can just receive more sample data to increase capabilities.
    <br>
    It's being taken further in image recognition services. Social media platforms like Facebook use it to automatically tag users. allowing easy notifying of those included in photos.
    <br>
    One of the most futuristic current uses is in self-driving cars. using image recognition to identify hazards, cars roadsigns and more. please see the relevant page on our website. being a core part of Artificial intelligence,  machine learning is necessary for these inventions to be used.
    <br>
    Unfourtantley the biggest current hindrance to its widespread usage is obtaining experience, its sample data. Sample data can be 'bad data' in multiple ways, such as not enough data, non-representative data, poor quality data, irrelevant features. This was seen in multiple facial recognition software where, due to sampling a primarily white collection of people, the facial detection had a much harder time differentiating from darker-skinned individuals.  it is likely however to get better over time and as algorithms get made smarter and fewer data would be necessary.
    <br>
    In the future, we will continue to see Machine learning in the medical field where it is currently being used to assist doctors in diagnosis. In one example a machine learning algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97% making this a powerful tool for doctors. Due to the nature of machine learning the better it gets the more people simply disregard its use as "just an alogorythim" as machine learning at its best is very simple and quick to use. No one is amazed at YouTube's recommendation feature even though the technology behind it is adapting millions of key points of data. This could lead to a future where machine learning may be just an automatic assumption, Always used but never considered.
