Researchers' algorithm designs soft robots that sense

Deep-learning technique optimizes the arrangement of sensors on a robot's body to ensure efficient operation.

What does it do? (600 words) What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?
<br>
Soft robots
<br>
There are fascinating developments going on in the world of robots. Robots have helped us to automate many repetitive tasks and made mass production possible. To this day robots have been used to automate processes that are repetitive, tedious and dangerous for humans. For precise movement quite a rigid frame is needed to allow the movements to be in a range of tolerances.
<br>
Rigid frames to become a problem when a robot is in a sensitive environment. Fast moving powerful robots can do lot of damage when something not planned to their usual work environment is being introduced. Thatâ€™s why a specific sub field of robotics has emerged.
<br>
Soft robots are made of materials that are flexible and compliant such as soft plastic and silicone elastomers. They are mostly powered by pressured air or fluids, but researchers are working on a methods that allow them to control and move through electric fields or thermal manipulation.
<br>
Often bio-inspired like mimicking octopus arms a twisting grasping arm was designed to retrieve objects obstructing in tight spaces like inside of pipes (https://www.advancedsciencenews.com/mimicking-the-motions-of-the-multitalented-octopus) or Mariana snailfish inspired deep sea exploration device that can withstand extreme pressures(https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-soft-robot-snailfish-crushing-pressures-deep-ocean).
<br>
Right now soft robots are still in baby steps.
<br>
Medical use
<br>
They have great potential in the field of medical devices for minimal invasive surgery. Robot bodies that are mode of soft materials will reduce the risk of causing damage to tissues and organs during endoscopic ( in body) procedures. So far treating brain cancer on patients has had quite low survival rate because of the tumor tissue being very difficult to remove  using conventional methods due to limited access. Soft robot technology has a change to change that.
<br>
(https://robomed.gatech.edu/minir/) Minimally Invasive Neurosurgical Intracranial Robot (MINI and MINIR-II) is a project with great potential to make brain tumor tissue removal much safer for the patient. It is a flexible snake like design consisting of three segments that are actuated using four SMA (shape memory alloy) spring actuators. When current is applied the spring generates displacement, when cooled it returns back to default value)

  <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
  <p>Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can automatically improve through experience.
    The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, Tom M. Mitchell later provided a more
    formal definiton:
    
    <i>"A computer program is said to learn from experience (E) with respect to some class of tasks (T) and
     performance measure (P) if its performance at tasks in (T), as measured by (P), improves with experience (E)."</i>
    - Mitchell, T. (1997). Machine Learning. McGraw Hill
    
    Algorithms are given a large amount of sample data to 'train' to find patterns and correlations.
    After doing so the program can make predictions for desired outputs.
    
    It's already used in programs everywhere. for example, email filtering can see what users usually report as 
    spam and find trends to automatically flag new emails as spam. This is great because creating a 
    conventional algorithm would be very difficult. Another feature is the programs ability to keep up to date.
    a conventional algorithm would have to be manually updated, but often machine learning programs like the
    email filter can just receive more sample data to increase capabilities.
    
    Its being taken further in image recogniton services. Social media platforms like Facebook use it to
    automaticly tag people</p>
