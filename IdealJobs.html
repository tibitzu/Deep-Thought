John Mafunda's ideal job is a position offered in a team role, the hybrid cloud engineer will be working in a team to provide improvements to managed services customer environments, with the cloud engineer tasked to improve customer environments though automation and optimisation. This role I believe would be a perfect mid-term goal as my long-term goal would be to work with larger companies such as Steam or Google in projects like ‘Steam cloud play’ or ‘Google Stadia’ these being projects which I’m interested in, as the ambition is if there is access to a stable internet connection you gain full access to cloud storage, services or even computing power all through the cloud. These projects in particular attempt to enable games to be played with less powerful, cheaper hardware as the computing and processing of the game is completed remotely through cloud computing thus enabling consumers to not have to buy expensive hardware to play the games at their recommended or intended setting. This role as a hybrid cloud engineer will be a fundamental steppingstone in understanding the role of a cloud engineer with the benefit of being able to work in a team and gain experience interfacing with clients.

<p>Marek Ivanov's ideal Job is an integral part of cyber secrurity, mostly considered to be an "ethical hacker". The jobs role is trying to find weaknesses in a network, Penetration testing can involve the attempted breaching of any number of application systems, (e.g., application protocol interfaces (APIs), frontend/backend servers) to uncover vulnerabilities, such as unsanitized inputs that are susceptible to code injection attacks.

Insights provided by the penetration test can be used to fine-tune your WAF security policies and patch detected vulnerabilities.
<br><br>

Deep Thoughts ideal Jobs are mostly quite varied, Other than Tibor and Elijah who both share an interest in game design, all the other group members have ideal jobs in completely different fields and roles with the information technology industry. However, there are similarities with the career paths of each member, Other than Marek, who only requires to know operating systems, networking and cyber security, all the other members need a strong a understanding and capability with C programming language, John's reuires addition knowledge in linex and machine learning. All of the members are not in a position to qualify for their ideal jobs and hope to acquire the skills required over the course of their degree in Information Technology.
