      &emsp;Do you feel confident in yourself or eager for self improvement?<br>
      <br>
      Our group's results are to the right! -------><br>
      <br>
      <b>-We are all extroverts.</b> 
      &emsp;This is very helpful for working as a group. This means meetings are often good ways for us to catch up.<br>
      &emsp; overall the group being extroverted has made bonding with eachother much easier as we all are relaxed with talking<br>
      <b>-We are primarly Intuitive.</b><br>
      &emsp; This has been useful as we have been able to focus on tasks given to us and needed very little teaching from the group<br>
      &emsp; as any information we were missing could be independently found. Elijah has been given help with mini tutorials as he<br>
      &emsp; needs<br>
      <b>-We are primarly Feeling</b><br>
      &emsp;This has shown as we all seem fairly attached to our contributions to page allowing our passion to flow through.<br>
      &emsp;This can cause issues as critizem is very easy missread as an attack on a person rather than the work itself<br>
      &emsp;To our groups benifits Tibor, our team leader, is very good at distancing people from the work and makes a great<br>
      &emsp;for settling arguments in an objective mannor by being a thinker<br>
      <b>-We are primarly Prospecting</b><br>
      &emsp;This is good because most of us have been accepting of all jobs that get tasked to them but could cause issues<br>
      &emsp;in the form of lack of strucuture.
      <b>-We split between Assertive and Turbulent</b><br>
      &emsp;This balance urges the group as a whole to strive to be as good as they possibly can but allows the group to accept their work.<br>
      &emsp;Elijah and Tai probably find it useful to be grounded in reality to make sure that they're not overwhelming themselves.<br>
      &emsp;Tibor and John can ensure that the groups work has reasonable and reachable goals.
